    "# Image Classification\n",
    "In this project, you'll classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).  The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded.  You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.  At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.\n",
